/**
 * Whenever the king changes bucket, a costly full refresh of the accumulator is required. This service implements a
 * technique to improve the performance of this refresh known as 'Finny tables'.
 * </p>
 * We keep a cache of the last accumulator and board state used for each bucket. When refreshing, instead of starting
 * from an empty board, we start from the last board state used for the bucket. We therefore only need to apply the diff
 * between the last board state and the current board state to the accumulator.
