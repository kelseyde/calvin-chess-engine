/**
 * Correction history tracks how much the static evaluation of a position matched the actual search score. We can use
 * this information to 'correct' the current static eval based on the diff between the static eval and the search score
 * of previously searched positions.
 * <p>
 * This is a similar heuristic to re-using the cached search score in the {@link TranspositionTable}, except rather than
 * using the score from the exact same position, we use a running average of eval diffs of previously searched positions
 * which share some feature, e.g. pawn structure, material balance, and so on.
 * <p>
 * The running average also gives more weight to positions that were searched to a greater depth, as these are more
 * likely to have a more accurate final search score.
